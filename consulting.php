                        All products are developed using a methodology. In some cases the methodology is well
                        conceived, with significant thought put into its definition. In other instances the methodology 
                        grows organically with the product and the team. And, in some cases, the methodology is poorly
                        defined. The chosen (or default) methodology influences all aspects of the product

        		            (and doesn't do what is is not supposed to do)?</li>
        		        <li>Quality - how do you confirm that the product will meet you customer's needs?</li>
        		        <li>Delivery - how do you deliver, install and update your product?</li>

                        <span class="term">Methodology</span> plays a significant role in product development efficiency. If your
                        products can be continuously
                        updated, such as SaaS or mobile products, then an agile methodology such as SCRUM could likely be best
                        for you. On the other hand, if you are delivering hardware, perhaps a waterfall method is more
                        appropriate. Even in that case, the software developed for the hardware could still be developed using
                        an agile methodology.

                    <p>
                        Perhaps your product is used in an environment that requires process such as safety or security.
                        Markets such as avionics, automotive, medical, robotics, defense and many others fall into these
                        categories. In these cases process frameworks such as DO-178B/C, IEC 61508, ISO 9001, CMMI, AS 9100,
                        FDA 510k, Automotive SPICE and Common Criteria are key to product success. If not, you might still
                        choose to use ISO 9001 if you are a manufacturing facility or CMMI for software development.

                        Successful program
                        managers knows exactly where a program is in the lifecycle, what has been accomplished and

                    <p>
                        Effective program management is often the difference between on-time, on-budget product delivery and
                        a product that is late and over budget. Selecting the proper tools and processes to monitor
                        program progress is essential to detect problems early and, better yet, to predict problems
                        before they happen. Acting quickly to identify and mitigate risks helps keep programs
                        on track.

                        is defined by
                        the customer. If the customer is satisfied and getting good value from your products, then your quality

                        in an organization and driving activities that deliver quality are paramount to achieving high customer
                        satisfaction. Many years of experience operating quality organizations help us to evaluate

                    <p>
                        <span class="term">Metrics</span> are collected by most companies. Some companies review these metrics
                        and reach conclusions
                        as to whether the lifecycle is performing well. The real question is: how did we choose these metrics?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A good set of metrics starts with goals. What do you expect from your lifecycle? How should it perform?
                        This is not the time to define the metrics, but rather to understand what is needed from the
                        lifecycle. Once these goals are well understood the next step is to ask: how will we know if the lifecycle
                        is meeting these goals? The resulting set of questions then drives a set of metrics that answer these
                        questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, suppose that a company goal is to have no more than 5% deviation from schedule
                        for a release. A question for this goal might be: &quot;How far off of the straight line schedule
                        is this project?&quot;. The metric used to answer this question depends on your particular lifecycle
                        model. A SCRUM team might use story points done against total story points in the release to understand
                        whether the team is on track. A waterfall team might use earned value to understand how far through the
                        product development cycle the team has gotten against the total amount of work defined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, metrics must be reviewed on an ongoing basis. This can be done in many different ways. A
                        SCRUM team can look at these metrics as part of the sprint planning meetings and sprint review meetings.
                        A waterfall team (and even a SCRUM project) needs regular program reviews to go over these
                        metrics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Metrics drive behavior, both good and bad. We can help you to define and measure data that encourages the
                        right behavior, and guarantees success.

            			I am a Product Development Executive who forms highly motivated teams that are excited about their work and
            			proud of their accomplishments. I lead these teams to deliver software that exceeds customer expectations in both 
            			functionality and quality in the face of conflicting priorities and demands. I contribute to deep technical product 
            			architecture, design and implementation discussions. I communicate effectively with employees, peers, and customers.
            			I meet budgets and schedules. I balance strategy with tactics.

            			As Vice President Global Quality at
            			<a href="http://www.grassvalley.com" target="_blank">Grass Valley Systems</a>, I drove the use of metrics and
            			analysis that resulted in a direct savings of over $1M in my first 3 months. Ongoing work deepened our understanding of 
            			customer satisfaction and overall product quality.
        			</p>
        			<p>
            			Prior to Grass Valley I held the role of Vice President, Certified Platforms Engineering at
            			<a href="http://www.windriver.com" target="_blank">Wind River</a>, which was acquired by
            			<a href="http://www.intel.com" target="_blank">Intel</a> in 2010.  I also worked for
            			<a href="http://www.harris.com/" target="_blank">Harris Corporation</a> and
            			<a href="http://www.lucent.com/" target="_blank">Lucent Technologies</a>, as part of the acquisition of
            			Ascend Communications. I graduated from <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">U. C. Berkeley</a>
            			with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I started as a software engineer, however I found that my greatest
            			skills and contributions were in technical engineering management.

        			<p>I try to learn something new all of the time. Here are a few of my more recent endeavors.</p>
        			
        			<ul>
				<li>I purchased a <a href="http://www.getpebble.com/" target="_blank">Pebble Watch</a> during its
				<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>
				campaign. Since receiving the watch I've developed a few watchfaces (in 'C'), an iOS app (in Objective-C) and some Javascript to control
				the watchfaces. Fun, and educational, all at once!</li>
				
				<li>This web page is the result of boning up on HTML, CSS and PHP. I'm working on how flexible CSS can be without introducing Javascript on
				a web page and using PHP to create dynamic pages.</li>
				
				<li>Recently I've been taking <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/course/ipad-iphone-app-development/id495052415" target="_blank">cs193p</a> from Stanford on iTunes U.
				It's amazing how much is available out there. Taught by Paul Hegarty, who was hired by Steve Jobs at NeXT Computer, this course educates
				one on how to write useful apps for the iPhone and iPad. I switched from Java/Android to iOS since I am an iPhone, iPad and Mac owner.
				While I can't run these apps on the web, here are the program requirements and a few <a href="cs193p">screen shots</a>:</li>
				
				<li>Prior to iOS I spent some time with Java. The growing importance of Android in many markets, included embedded systems drove me to
				get a grasp on how Java works, and how to create an app. Here are a few of <a href="cs106a">my applets</a>, I realize that they still need a
				bit of work.</li>
