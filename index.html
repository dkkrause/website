			<h2>Professional Summary</h2>

			<p>I am a Software Engineering Executive who forms highly motivated teams that are excited about their work and proud of their
			accomplishments. I lead these teams to deliver software that exceeds customer expectations in both functionality and quality in the face of conflicting
		    priorities and demands. I contribute to deep technical product architecture, design and implementation discussions. I communicate effectively with

			<h2>What Am I Learning?</h2>
			<p>I try to learn something new all of the time. Here are a few of my more recent endeavors.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>This web page is the result of boning up on HTML, CSS and PHP. I'm working on how flexible CSS can be without introducing Javascript on
				a web page and using PHP to create dynamic pages.</li>
				
				<li>Recently I've been taking <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/course/ipad-iphone-app-development/id495052415">cs193p</a> from Stanford on iTunes U.
				It's amazing how much is available out there. Taught by Paul Hegarty, who was hired by Steve Jobs at NeXT Computer, this course educates
				one on how to write useful apps for the iPhone and iPad. I switched from Java/Android to iOS since I am an iPhone, iPad and Mac owner.
				While I can't run these apps on the web, here are the program requirements and a few <a href="cs193p">screen shots</a>:</li>
				
				<li>Prior to iOS I spent some time with Java. The growing importance of Android in many markets, included embedded systems drove me to
				get a grasp on how Java works, and how to create an app. Here are a few of <a href="cs106a">my applets</a>, I realize that they still need a
				bit of work.:</p>
			</ul>

			<h2>Interests Outside of Work</h2>
			
			<p> My family is heavily involved in swimming so I became a <a href="http://www.pacswim.org/page/member_officials.shtml">Stroke and Turn Judge,
			Starter and Referee</a> with <a href="http://www.pacswim.org/">Pacific Swimming</a>. I have been active in
			<a href="http://www.alamedaislanders.org/">Alameda Island Aquatics</a>, serving as Vice President for 5 years and President for 3 years. AIA
			is a non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable organization that promotes swimming and fitness for children ages 6-18.</p>
