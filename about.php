        			<p>
            			I am a Product Development Executive who forms highly motivated teams that are excited about their work and
            			proud of their accomplishments. I lead these teams to deliver software that exceeds customer expectations in both 
            			functionality and quality in the face of conflicting priorities and demands. I contribute to deep technical product 
            			architecture, design and implementation discussions. I communicate effectively with employees, peers, and customers.
            			I meet budgets and schedules. I balance strategy with tactics.
        			</p>
        			<p>
            			As Vice President Global Quality at
            			<a href="http://www.grassvalley.com" target="_blank">Grass Valley Systems</a>, I drove the use of metrics and
            			analysis that resulted in a direct savings of over $1M in my first 3 months. Ongoing work deepened our understanding of 
            			customer satisfaction and overall product quality.
        			</p>
        			<p>
            			Prior to Grass Valley I held the role of Vice President, Certified Platforms Engineering at
            			<a href="http://www.windriver.com" target="_blank">Wind River</a>, which was acquired by
            			<a href="http://www.intel.com" target="_blank">Intel</a> in 2010.  I also worked for
            			<a href="http://www.harris.com/" target="_blank">Harris Corporation</a> and
            			<a href="http://www.lucent.com/" target="_blank">Lucent Technologies</a>, as part of the acquisition of
            			Ascend Communications. I graduated from <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">U. C. Berkeley</a>
            			with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I started as a software engineer, however I found that my greatest
            			skills and contributions were in technical engineering management.

        			<p>I try to learn something new all of the time. Here are a few of my more recent endeavors.</p>
        			
        			<ul>
				<li>I purchased a <a href="http://www.getpebble.com/" target="_blank">Pebble Watch</a> during its
				<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>
				campaign. Since receiving the watch I've developed a few watchfaces (in 'C'), an iOS app (in Objective-C) and some Javascript to control
				the watchfaces. Fun, and educational, all at once!</li>
				
				<li>This web page is the result of boning up on HTML, CSS and PHP. I'm working on how flexible CSS can be without introducing Javascript on
				a web page and using PHP to create dynamic pages.</li>
				
				<li>Recently I've been taking <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/course/ipad-iphone-app-development/id495052415" target="_blank">cs193p</a> from Stanford on iTunes U.
				It's amazing how much is available out there. Taught by Paul Hegarty, who was hired by Steve Jobs at NeXT Computer, this course educates
				one on how to write useful apps for the iPhone and iPad. I switched from Java/Android to iOS since I am an iPhone, iPad and Mac owner.
				While I can't run these apps on the web, here are the program requirements and a few <a href="cs193p">screen shots</a>:</li>
				
				<li>Prior to iOS I spent some time with Java. The growing importance of Android in many markets, included embedded systems drove me to
				get a grasp on how Java works, and how to create an app. Here are a few of <a href="cs106a">my applets</a>, I realize that they still need a
				bit of work.</li>
